# MyGoAPI

MyGoAPI is a scalable, modular REST API built using Go, designed with a clean architecture approach. It includes robust features like middleware support, structured logging, and configuration management.

---

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Loosely coupled components with clean separation of concerns.
- **Context Management:** Optimized for timeout and cancellation of operations.
- **Middleware:** Common utilities for logging, request tracing, and authentication.
- **Validation:** Input validation using `go-playground/validator`.
- **Dependency Injection:** Simplified service management with interfaces.
- **Environment-Based Configuration:** Support for dev, test, and production setups.
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Observability:** Metrics and tracing support.

## Requirements

- Go 1.19+
- PostgreSQL (or compatible database)
- `protoc` (for gRPC, if required)
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration management

## Roadmap and Future Enhancements

### Immediate Tasks

- Implement structured logging using `zap`.
- Add input validation using `go-playground/validator`.
- Secure JWT-based authentication.

### Future Enhancements

- **Support for gRPC:** Add `grpc` delivery layer for high-performance RPC communication.
- **Rate Limiting:** Use `go-rate` to limit API abuse.
- **API Versioning:** Use OpenAPI and Swagger for version control and documentation.
- **Cache Layer:** Implement caching for frequent data with `groupcache`.
- **Observability:** Integrate Prometheus and Jaeger for metrics and tracing.
- **Multi-Environment Configurations:** Add staging and production profiles.
